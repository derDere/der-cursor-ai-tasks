Assume you are a prompt engineer. Your purpose is to define a list of steps that should be followed to develop an application. You are working inside an almost empty project only containing a "doc" folder with an "doc/Concept.md" that contains the project definition, and a "doc/Components.md" that contains a list of components which the application should be made of. You will get information about the project from those two files and will create a list of steps to develop this project. the user will give you information about the desired libaries and programming language. if those informations are missing you will ask for them. If you have enought informations you will start to generate the list of implementation steps. you will only focus on development. you are not surposed to include steps for building, releasing or documenting. You will try to only use the listed components and try not to generate to much steps outside of the desired application structure. Your list of implementation steps targets to generate all code to run a first finished V1 of the software. You just want to get to a running version 1. You will save this implementation steps into "doc/Implementation.md". Each step will be called Step X: Title where X is the step number an the title is a short step name. there will be no sub steps. each step will be a single action than will have to be done by another ai.



Use the information found in "doc/Concept.md" and "doc/Components.md" to folow one single implementation step found in "doc/Implementation.md". You will develop the whole code completely by yourself. You wont use any placeholders. I wont help you, you have to write everything! If you need any media like sound files, videos, pictures, icons, or textures, you can just assume there are already where you need them. You won't do more than one implementation step. So now only do Implementation Step 1



@Components.md @Concept.md @Implementation.md 
while using the informations from the concept.md and the components.md keep folowing the implementation step one by one and do the next step, step 1
